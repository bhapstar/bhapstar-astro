The Askar V arrives as a system — two interchangeable ED apochromatic objectives, a reducer, a flattener, an extender — offering six distinct focal lengths from 270mm to 600mm. Wide and sweeping one night, tight and intimate the next. Chromatic aberration is reduced to near nothing, leaving only the quiet precision of starlight falling cleanly onto the sensor.",
